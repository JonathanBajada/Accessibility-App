An application that caters towards people who are often marginalized. The application allows users to upload a txt file or a pdf and is given options to change the output. Changes include: font, font size, font weight, font colour, document background colour, underline all hyperlinks  and etc. All selected changes will be applied and outputted onto the screen. The user can then save the processed txt file into their computer. Alternatively, user can upload a txt file, and choose between a female or male voice (if unselected the default voice will be female), the text will be automatically read by an artificial voice. The entire application will comply to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
